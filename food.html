        <h4>Egyptian Food</h4>
        <p><b><i>If you are a foodie traveller and always eager to discover new flavours in the places you visit, you will love Egypt. Although its food is full of Mediterranean-style ingredients that will be familiar to you, the way in which they are prepared is completely different to in Europe due to its African and Arab influences. There are a wide range of dishes on offer, from typical mezzes, or appetisers, that are usually served before the first course, to fish, meat and all kinds of vegetables. Vegetarians will not have any problems eating in Egypt.</i></b></p>
